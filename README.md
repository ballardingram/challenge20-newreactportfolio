# New React Portfolio
This is part of Challenge 20 - React Portfolio for my UT Bootcamp Full Stack Program.

## Built With
This application was built with React and Tailwind. There was no starter code.

## Contributions
This was largely an independent project. I worked iwth my Tutor on the GH Pages deployment after I received a few 404 page errors. This is the 2nd time that I used Tailwind to create a project and relied on their documentation to get this done.

## Opportunities
Aside from the 404 error, I really did not have a lot of opportunities with this code. I enjoyed REACT and how the pages routed together.

## Future Development
I want to make my contact me page fully functional so I can use this as an actual website. I would also like to carosel my projects so when I add them my site it doesn't have "clunky" formatting.
